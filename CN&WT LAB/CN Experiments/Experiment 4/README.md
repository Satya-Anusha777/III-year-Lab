# Experimet 4

## Aim of the Experiment
Write a C program to implement Dijsktra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path through a network.

### Steps or Procedure of experiment

Dijsktra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in a weighted graph.

### Algorithm

1.Create cost matrix C[ ][ ] from adjacency matrix adj[ ][ ]. C[i][j] is the cost of going
from vertex i to vertex j. If there is no edge between vertices i and j then C[i][j] is
infinity.

2.Array visited[ ] is initialized to zero.

 for(i=0;i<n;i++)
 
 visited[i]=0;
 
3.If the vertex 0 is the source vertex then visited[0] is marked as 1.

4.Create the distance matrix, by storing the cost of vertices from vertex no. 0 to n-1
from the source vertex 0.

 for (i=1; i<n;i++)
 
 distance[i]=cost[0][i];
 
 Initially, distance of source vertex is taken as 0. i.e. distance[0]=0;
 
5.for(i=1;i<n;i++)

 – Choose a vertex w, such that distance[w] is minimum and visited[w] is 0.
   Mark visited[w] as 1.
   
 – Recalculate the shortest distance of remaining vertices from the source.

 – Only, the vertices not marked as 1 in array visited[ ] should be considered for
 recalculation of distance. i.e. for each vertex v

  if(visited[v]==0)
  
  distance[v]=min(distance[v],
  
  distance[w]+cost[w][v])
